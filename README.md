# DNA-Sequence-Analysis-Toolkit

## Overview
DNA-Sequence-Analysis-Toolkit is a Python library/module designed to process and analyze DNA sequences stored in FASTA files. It provides a suite of functions to read FASTA files, count sequences, calculate sequence lengths, identify open reading frames (ORFs), and detect sequence repeats. This tool is intended for bioinformaticians, researchers, and developers working with genetic data.

## Features
***Reading FASTA files***: Parses a FASTA file and stores sequences in a dictionary.

***Sequence Counting***: Counts the number of sequences in a FASTA file or dictionary.

***Sequence Lengths***: Calculates the length of each sequence.

***Longest and Shortest Sequences***: Identifies sequences with the maximum and minimum lengths.

***Forward Reading Frames***: Generates three forward reading frames for each sequence.

***Open Reading Frames <ins>(ORFs)</ind>***: Identifies ORFs in forward reading frames.

***Longest ORF***: Finds the longest ORF in a given sequence or dataset.

***Repeat Analysis***: Counts repeated sequences of specified lengths.
